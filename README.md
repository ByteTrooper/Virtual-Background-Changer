# Virtual-Background-Changer
The virtual background changer project is a sophisticated digital image processing system that utilizes advanced segmentation techniques to distinguish the foreground and background in a video frame. The system makes use of a self-segmentation method that uses a combination of color and edge-based features to detect the human in the frame and segment them as the foreground.

Once the human has been accurately detected and segmented, a pretrained neural network model is used to further improve the accuracy of the segmentation. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of human images and can accurately recognize a human body even in complex backgrounds.

The segmentation and neural network model work in tandem to accurately detect and separate the foreground from the background in real-time. Users can then replace the background with any image or video of their choice, providing a seamless and professional virtual background for video conferencing, online classes, or remote work.

This project is particularly useful for people who work from home or remotely, as it provides a simple and efficient solution to create a professional virtual setting without having to worry about the physical surroundings. It also showcases the power of advanced image processing techniques and machine learning, and has the potential to transform the way we work and communicate in the digital age.
